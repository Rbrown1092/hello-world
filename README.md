# hello-world
This is a repository for my classwork in Code KY
My name is Robert, I'm 31 turning 32 in may. I wanted to be a part of this industry for as long as I can remember, but life kept getting in the way every stage.
I have 2 kids, a wife 2 dogs, 2 fish, a bearded dragon, and like 4 - maybe - 4892 cats.
